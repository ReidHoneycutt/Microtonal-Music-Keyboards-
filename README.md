Some scripts for mapping the computer keyboard keys to microtonal scales of various kinds, making the keyboard act like a synth.



Row 1 (z–/) → plays Major chords directly

Row 2 (a–\) → minor chords

Row 3 (q–]) → adds 7th extensions

Row 4 (1–=) → combined with 1 + 2 + 3 produces diminished 

Row 1 + 2 + 3 → dominate chord

Fully polyphonic — multiple keys from different rows can be played at once
