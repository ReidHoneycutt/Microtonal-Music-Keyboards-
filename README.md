Some scripts for mapping the computer keyboard keys to microtonal scales of various kinds, making the keyboard act like a synth.

For the "maj, min, maj7, min7, dom chord keyboard.pde" keyboard variant, the following rules apply:

- Row 1 (z–/) → plays Major chords directly

- Row 2 (a–\) → minor chords

- Row 3 (q–]) → adds 7th extensions

- Row 4 (1–=) → combined with 1 + 2 + 3 produces diminished 

- Row 1 + 2 + 3 → dominate chord

- Fully polyphonic — multiple keys from different rows can be played at once
